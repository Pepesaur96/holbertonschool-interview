Imagine you have a text file with just one letter 'H' in it. You can only perform two actions: "Copy All" (copy everything in the file) and "Paste" (paste what you copied). The goal is to get exactly n 'H' characters in the file using the fewest actions possible.

## Here's how you can think about it:

1. Start with 1 'H': You already have one 'H' in your file.
2. Copy All and Paste to Multiply: Each time you "Paste", you double the number of 'H's if you copied everything before. For example, if you have 2 'H's and you "Copy All" and then "Paste", you will have 4 'H's.

To make it more efficient, think of multiplying the number of 'H's step by step using the fewest actions:

## Step-by-Step Example to Reach 9 'H's:

1. Start with 1 'H':

- Current state: H

2. Copy All and Paste (you now have 2 'H's):

- Action: Copy All, Paste
- Current state: HH
- Number of operations: 2 (Copy All + Paste)

3. Copy All and Paste 2 more times (you now have 6 'H's):

- Action: Copy All, Paste, Paste, Paste
- Current state: HHHHHH
- Number of operations: 3 (Copy All + 2 Pastes)

4. Copy All and Paste 3 more times (you now have 9 'H's):

- Action: Copy All, Paste, Paste, Paste
- Current state: HHHHHHHHH
- Number of operations: 3 (Copy All + 2 Pastes)

## Total Operations:

- Initial copy and paste to get 2 'H's: 2 operations
- Copy and paste to get 6 'H's: 3 operations
- Copy and paste to get 9 'H's: 3 operations
- Total: 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 operations

## Key Idea:

- To reach n characters, we break down n into smaller multiplications.
- For each multiplication step, we use "Copy All" once and then "Paste" multiple times.
- By doing this, we minimize the number of operations needed.

## General Method:

1. Factorize n: Break n into smaller factors.
2. Repeat Copy and Paste: Use "Copy All" and then "Paste" the necessary number of times for each factor.

This way, you can efficiently reach exactly n 'H's with the fewest actions.

## Simplified Explanation:

Think of "Copy All" as preparing to multiply your 'H's, and each "Paste" as actually multiplying the number of 'H's. By smartly choosing when to copy and how many times to paste, you can quickly build up to the number you want with fewer steps.
