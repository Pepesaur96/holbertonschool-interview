In this code, we have implemented a function reverse_list to reverse a linked list and a function compare_lists to compare two linked lists. The is_palindrome function uses these helper functions to check if the linked list is a palindrome.

Here's how it works:

1. We find the middle of the linked list using the fast and slow pointer technique.
2. We reverse the second half of the list.
3. We compare the first half and the reversed second half.
4. We restore the original list by reversing the second half back to its original order.
5. We return 1 if the list is a palindrome and 0 otherwise.
