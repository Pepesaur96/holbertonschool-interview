# Plan

1. Define the Prototype: The function insert_node takes a double pointer to the head of the list and an integer number to be inserted. It returns the address of the new node or NULL if it fails.

2. Create a New Node: Allocate memory for the new node, initialize its value, and set its next pointer to NULL.

3. Handle Edge Cases:

   - If the list is empty, the new node becomes the head of the list.
   - If the new node needs to be inserted at the beginning of the list (i.e., the number is smaller than the head node's value).

4. Traverse the List: Find the correct position to insert the new node by iterating through the list. The new node should be inserted before the first node that has a value greater than the number being inserted.

5. Insert the Node: Adjust the pointers to insert the new node into the list.

# Explanation

1. Allocate Memory: We allocate memory for the new node and check if the allocation was successful. If not, we return NULL.

2. Edge Cases:

   - If the list is empty (\*head == NULL), or the new number is smaller than the head node's value, we insert the new node at the beginning of the list and update the head pointer.

3. Traverse the List: We use two pointers, current and prev, to find the appropriate position for the new node. current traverses the list while prev keeps track of the previous node.

4. Insert the Node: Once we find the correct position, we insert the new node by adjusting the pointers accordingly. new_node->next points to current, and prev->next points to new_node.
